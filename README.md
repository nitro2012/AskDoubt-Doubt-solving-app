## **ASKDOUBT - A DOUBT SOLVING ANDROID APP**
 AskDoubt  is an Android app that allows users to ask and answer questions. It is built using Java and the Chaquopy library, which allows Python code to be executed within the app.
 
The app features a question-answering system where Firebase-authenticated users can post questions, and other users can provide answers. The KeyBert Python library is used to extract keywords from the answers, which enhances the search functionality within the app.

The app has a user-friendly interface with a search bar that allows users to search for relevant keywords and retrieve answers associated with those keywords.

#### **Technical Aspects**
The app uses the following technologies:

* Java
* Chaquopy
* Firebase
* KeyBert
#### Impact
 AskDoubt has helped users to get their doubts answered quickly and easily. It has also helped to create a community of learners where users can share their knowledge and help each other.

#### Description
The app has two main modules:

##### Question Module:

Users can post questions in this module.
They can also view questions that have already been posted, and answer them if they know the answer.
##### Answer Module:

Users can provide answers to questions in this module.
They can also view answers that have already been posted, and like or dislike them if they do or do not find them helpful.
The app also has a search bar that allows users to search for questions or answers that contain specific keywords.

#### Key Learnings
I learned a lot from this project, including:

* How to use the Chaquopy library to execute Python code within an Android app.
* How to use the KeyBert library to extract keywords from text.
* How to implement a question-answering system.
* How to design a user-friendly interface.
